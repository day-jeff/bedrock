# Azure Cluster Deployment

## Getting Started

Beyond the [base requirements](../README.md) for Bedrock, we also need the Azure `az` command line tool installed for Azure Kubernetes clusters:

- [az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

## Creating a Cluster Environment

The typical way to create a new environment is to start from an existing template. For Azure, we currently have the following templates:

- [azure-simple](../environments/azure-simple): Single cluster deployment with Flux

So, for example, to create a cluster environment based on the `azure-simple` template, copy it to a new subdirectory with the name of your cluster:

```bash
$ cp -r cluster/environments/azure-simple cluster/environments/<cluster name>
```

With this new environment created, edit `environments/azure/<cluster name>/terraform.tfvars` and update the following variables (for a full list of customizable variables see [variables.tf](../azure/aks/variables.tf)):

- `resource_group_name`: Name of the resource group for the cluster
- `resource_group_location`: Azure region the resource group should be created in.
- `cluster_name`: Name of the Kubernetes cluster
- `agent_vm_count`: The number of agents VMs in the the node pool.
- `dns_prefix`: DNS name for accessing the cluster from the internet.
- `service_principal_id`: The id of the service principal used by the AKS cluster.  This is generated using the Azure CLI (see [Creating Service Principal](#creating-service-principal) for details).
- `service_principal_secret`: The secret of the service principal used by the AKS cluster.  This is generated using the Azure CLI (see [Creating Service Principal](#creating-service-principal) for details).
- `ssh_public_key`: Contents of a public key authorized to access the virtual machines within the cluster.
- `gitops_url`: The git repo that contains the resource manifests that should be deployed in the cluster in ssh format (eg. `git@github.com:timfpark/fabrikate-cloud-native-manifests.git`). This repo must have a deployment key configured to accept changes from `gitops_ssh_key` (see [Configuring Gitops Repository for Flux](#setting-up-gitops-repository-for-flux) for more details).
- `gitops_ssh_key`: Path to the *private key file* that was configured to work with the Gitops repository.

Finally, if you are deploying a production cluster, you will want to [configure storage](#storing-terraform-state) of Terraform state.

## Deploying Cluster

Bedrock requires a bash shell for the executing the automation. Currently MacOSX, Ubuntu, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) are supported.

Terraform relies on a set of four environmental variables to provide it with the 
authorization it needs to deploy the cluster. Set these in your shell with a service principal that is authorized to create infrastructure for the desired subscription (see [Creating Service Principal](#creating-service-principal) below for details) before you start deployment:

```
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=xxxxxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-xxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyy
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-xxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyy
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-xxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyy
export ARM_TENANT_ID=xxxxxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-xxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyy
```

Then, from the directory of the cluster you defined above (eg. `environments/azure/<cluster name>`), run:

```
$ terraform init
```

This will download all of the modules needed for the deployment.  You can then deploy the cluster with:

```
$ terraform apply
```

This will display the plan for what infrastructure Terraform plans to deploy into your subscription and ask for your confirmation.

Once you have confirmed the plan, Terraform will deploy the cluster, install [Flux](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux)
in the cluster to start a [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request) operator in the cluster, and deploy any resource manifests in the `gitops_url`.

Once your cluster has been created the credentials for the cluster will be placed in the specified `output_directory` which defaults to `./output`. 

With the default kube config file name, you can copy this to your `~/.kube/config` by executing:

```bash
$ KUBECONFIG=./output/bedrock_kube_config:~/.kube/config kubectl config view --flatten > merged-config && mv merged-config ~/.kube/config
```

In a multi cluster deployment environment, you can copy this to your `~/.kube/config` by replacing `location` and `clustername` in the following command for each cluster:
```
$ KUBECONFIG=./output/<location>-<clustername>_kube_config:~/.kube/config kubectl config view --flatten > merged-config && mv merged-config ~/.kube/config
```

or directly use the kube_config file with default output file name:

```
$ KUBECONFIG=./output/bedrock_kube_config kubectl get po --namespace=flux` 
```

or directly use the kube_config file by replacing `location` and `clustername` in the following command in multi cluster deployment:

```
$ KUBECONFIG=./output/<location>-<clustername>_kube_config kubectl get po --namespace=flux` 
```

### Creating Service Principal

You can generate an Azure service principal for a particular subscription with the following `az` cli command:

```bash
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --subscription 
{
  "appId": "50d65587-abcd-4619-1234-f99fb2ac0987",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2019-01-23-20-27-37",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2019-01-23-20-27-37",
  "password": "3ac38e00-aaaa-bbbb-bb87-7222bc4b1f11",
  "tenant": "72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47"
}
```

### Setting Up Gitops Repository for Flux

Flux watches a Git repository containing the resource manifests that should be deployed into the Kubernetes cluster, and, as such, we need to configure that repo and give Flux permissions to access it at cluster creation time.

1.  Create the repo to use for Gitops (this example will assume that you are using Github, but Gitlab and Azure Devops are also supported).
2.  Create/choose a SSH key pair that will be given permission to do read/write access to the repository.  You can create an ssh key pair with the following:

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f gitops_repo_key
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in gitops_repo_key.
Your public key has been saved in gitops_repo_key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:DgAbaIRrET0rM/U5PIT0mcBFVMW/AQ9sRJ/TsdcmmFA
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|o+Bo=+..*+..E.   |
|oo Xo.o  *..ooo .|
|..+ B+. . =+oo..o|
|.= . B     +. .o |
|. +   + S   o    |
|       o   .     |
|        .        |
|                 |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
$ ls -l gitops_repo_key*
-rw-------  1 jims  staff  1823 Jan 24 16:28 gitops_repo_key
-rw-r--r--  1 jims  staff   398 Jan 24 16:28 gitops_repo_key.pub
```

3.  Add the SSH key to the repository

Flux requires read and write access to the resource manifest git repository. For Github, the process to add a deploy key is documented 
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/).

### Storing Terraform State

Terraform records the information about what is created in a [Terraform state file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/) after it finishes applying.  By default, Terraform will create a file named `terraform.tfstate` in the directory where Terraform is applied.  Terraform needs this information so that it can be loaded when we need to know the state of the cluster for future modifications.

In production scenarios, storing the state file on a local file system is not desired because typically you want to share the state between operators of the system.  Instead, we configure Terraform to store state remotely, and in Bedrock we use Azure Blob Store for this storage.  This is defined using a `backend` block.  The basic block looks like:

```bash
terraform {
   backend “azure” {
   }
}
```

In order to setup an Azure backend, navigate to the [backend state](./backend-state) directory and issue the following command:

```bash
> terraform apply -var 'name=<storage account name>' -var 'location=<storage account location>' -var 'resource_group_name=<storage account resource group>'
```

where `storage account name` is the name of the storage account to store the Terraform state, `storage account location` is the Azure region the storage account should be created in, and `storage account resource group` is the name of the resource group to create the storage account in.  

Once the storage account is created, we need to fetch storage account key so we can configure Terraform with it:

```bash
>  az storage account keys list --account-name <storage account name>
```

With this, update `backend.tfvars` file in your cluster environment directory with these values and use `terraform init -backend-config=./backend.tfvars` to setup usage of the Azure backend.
